// Assignment:1
// Backend System Design Using Queue
// Objective: Design and implement a backend system that efficiently manages requests from
// multiple users using a queue structure. Each client connected will have its queue where all
// requests will be processed sequentially. The system should be robust and scalable, ensuring
// that the queue is empty once all requests are processed and all users disconnect.
// Requirements:
// 1. User Authentication : Securely authenticate users before they can enqueue requests.
// 2. Request Queueing : Implement a queue for each client to handle requests in a
// First-In-First-Out (FIFO) manner.
// 3. Request Processing : Develop a process to handle and execute requests sequentially.
// 4. Concurrency Management : Handle multiple clients and their queues concurrently.
// 5. Scalability : Ensure the system can scale to handle an increasing number of users and
// requests without degradation in performance.
// 6. Robustness : Implement error handling and recovery mechanisms to manage failures without
// data loss.
// 7. Logging and Monitoring : Set up logging for tracking request handling and system monitoring
// for performance metrics.
// Tools and Technologies:
// - Programming Language : Node.js
// - Messaging/Queueing System : RabbitMQ / Redis / Kafka
// - Database : PostgreSQL / MongoDB
// - Monitoring Tools : Prometheus, Grafana
// System Design:
// - Client-Server Model : Users interact with the system through a client interface that sends
// requests to the server.
// - Queue Management : Each client connection has a dedicated queue. A queue manager
// handles the creation, management, and deletion of queues.
// - Worker Processes : Dedicated worker processes pull requests from queues and execute them
// sequentially.
// Assignment Tasks:
// 1. System Architecture :
// - Draw a system architecture diagram showing the client-server model, queue system,
// database, and worker processes.
// 2. Implementation :
// - Implement user authentication.
// - Setup the queue for each client.
// - Create worker processes that execute tasks from the queue.
// 3. Testing :

// - Write unit tests to verify the system's functionality under various scenarios.
// 4. Deployment :
// - Prepare a deployment plan using Docker containers for each component of the system.
// Flow Diagrams:
// 1. Overall System Flow :
// - Diagram showing the interaction between users, client interface, server, queues, and
// workers.
// 2. Detailed Process Flow :
// - A detailed diagram of how requests are received, authenticated, queued, processed, and
// logged.
// Submission Requirements:
// - Source code for all components.
// - Dockerfiles for building container images.
// - System and process flow diagrams.
// - Test cases and results.
// - Documentation explaining the system architecture and code.
