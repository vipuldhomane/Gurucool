// Assignment 2 :-
// Backend Assignment: Flow Distribution Algorithm
// Overview
// In this assignment, you'll be tasked with designing and implementing a flow distribution
// algorithm in Node.js for connecting users with astrologers. The goal is to ensure that each
// astrologer gets an equal proportion of chances to connect with users, while also providing the
// flexibility to adjust flow for top astrologers.
// Requirements
// 1. Design a flow distribution algorithm that allocates users to astrologers in a fair and balanced
// manner.
// 2. Implement a mechanism to toggle the flow for top astrologers, allowing them to receive more
// or fewer connections as desired.
// 3. Ensure that the algorithm can handle a daily flow of 2000-3000 users and a pool of 500
// astrologers efficiently.
// 4. Provide clear documentation explaining the logic behind your algorithm and how to use it.
// 5. Write test cases to validate the functionality of your algorithm.
// Implementation Steps
// 1. Data Structure : Define data structures to represent astrologers and users, including their
// attributes and current flow status.
// 2. Algorithm Design :
// - Implement a fair distribution algorithm that evenly distributes users among astrologers.
// - Incorporate a mechanism to adjust the flow for top astrologers based on user preferences.

// 3. API Design :
// - Create RESTful endpoints for controlling the flow distribution and toggling settings for top
// astrologers.
// 4. Backend Implementation :
// - Develop the backend logic in Node.js using Express.js or any other preferred framework.
// - Integrate the algorithm into the backend system to handle user requests and manage flow
// distribution.
// 5. Documentation :
// - Write comprehensive documentation explaining the flow distribution algorithm, its design
// principles, and how to interact with the API endpoints.
// 6. Testing :
// - Write unit tests to ensure the correctness of the algorithm and its behavior under various
// scenarios, including different user loads and settings for top astrologers.
// Deliverables
// - Node.js backend code implementing the flow distribution algorithm.
// - API documentation detailing how to interact with the backend endpoints.
// - Test cases to validate the functionality of the algorithm.
// - Documentation explaining the logic behind the algorithm and its design considerations.
// Additional Considerations
// - Scalability: Ensure that the algorithm can scale efficiently as the number of users and
// astrologers grows.
// - Performance: Optimize the algorithm and backend implementation for performance to handle
// the expected user flow.
// - Security: Implement appropriate security measures to protect sensitive data and prevent
// unauthorized access to the system.
// Conclusion
// This assignment will test your ability to design and implement a flow distribution algorithm that
// balances fairness with flexibility in a real-world application scenario. Good luck!
